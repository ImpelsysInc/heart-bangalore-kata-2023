## Localization and Globalization Strategies
## Status: Proposed
## Context
Road warriors application that needs to be accessible and usable by a global audience. To achieve this goal, we must decide on the strategies and best practices for localization (making the app culturally relevant) and globalization (making the app functionally compatible with different regions and languages).

## Decision
We have decided to adopt the following localization and globalization strategies:

**Language Support**: With Localization, the platform will support multiple languages, allowing users to interact with the system in their native or preferred language.

**Locale Detection**: The application will detect the user's locale and language preferences from their device settings or user profile. It will then display content in the user's preferred language and format (dates, numbers, currencies).

**Right-to-Left (RTL) Support**: For languages that are written from right to left, like Arabic and Hebrew, the application's layout and text direction will automatically adapt to RTL.

**Globalization (G11n)**:
Universal Date and Time Formats: We will use standardized date and time formats (e.g., ISO 8601) to ensure consistency across different regions.

**Region-Specific Data**: We will localize region-specific data such as address formats, postal codes, and phone number formats to match the conventions of each region.


## Decision Rationale
We chose these localization and globalization strategies because they allow us to make our application accessible and usable by a global audience. These strategies balance the need for cultural relevance and functional compatibility while maintaining a reasonable level of development complexity. While alternatives were considered, our selected strategies align with our project goals and resources.
