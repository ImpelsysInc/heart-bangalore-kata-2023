## Technology for mobile application

### Status: Proposed

## Context
We need to choose the technology stack for building the mobile application. The project's requirements include targeting both iOS and Android platforms,Fast development, maintaining code reusability, and ensuring a responsive and performant user experience. 
## Decision
We have decided to adopt React Native as our primary framework for building the mobile application for the following reasons:

**Cross-Platform Compatibility**: React Native allows us to develop a single codebase that can be used to build apps for both iOS and Android platforms, reducing development time and cost.

**Code Reusability**: React Native promotes code reusability by enabling us to share a significant portion of our codebase, including business logic and some UI components, between the two platforms.

**Performance**: React Native leverages native components and has optimizations like a bridge between JavaScript and native code, which results in near-native performance and a responsive user interface.

**Rich Ecosystem**: React Native has a vast ecosystem of libraries, tools, and community support, including third-party libraries and plugins for common mobile app functionalities.

**Large Developer Community**: The large and active React Native community means we can find resources, documentation, and expertise easily.

## Consequences
By choosing React Native as our mobile app development framework, we accept the following consequences:

Developers will need to learn React Native and may need time to adapt to mobile-specific development patterns.
We will need to manage platform-specific code and modules for any functionalities that are not readily available in React Native's core.
## Alternatives
## Alternative 1: Native Development (iOS and Android)
**Pros**: Full control over platform-specific features, optimal performance.
**Cons**: Requires separate codebases for iOS and Android, longer development timelines, and potentially higher costs.
## Alternative 2: Xamarin
**Pros**: Cross-platform capability, C# language support, integration with Visual Studio.
**Cons**: Smaller community compared to React Native, may require additional licensing for some features.
# Decision Rationale
React Native was chosen because it aligns with our project requirements for cross-platform development, code reusability, and performance. While other alternatives were considered, React Native's combination of developer productivity, performance, and a thriving community makes it a strong choice for our mobile app development project.
