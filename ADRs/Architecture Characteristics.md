## Top 3 Characteristics
### Scalability
 Scalability allows the system to accommodate a growing user base and increased data volume, ensuring that Road Warrior can scale its services as it gains more users.

### Availability
"99.99% uptime" is a High availability, with a maximum of 5 minutes per month of unplanned downtime, is essential to ensure travelers can access their reservations and updates reliably.
### Responsiveness
 Responsiveness in the user interface is vital for providing a positive user experience, allowing travelers to quickly access and manage their travel information.

 ## Other Characteristics
### Interoperability
 Interoperability is crucial to seamlessly integrate with external travel systems and agencies, ensuring smooth data exchange and collaboration.

### Elasticity
 Elasticity enables the system to dynamically scale resources up or down in response to varying workloads, ensuring cost-efficiency and optimal performance.

### Performance
 Performance optimization is critical to meet the specified response times and deliver real-time travel updates quickly and efficiently.

### Reliability
 Reliability is paramount to ensure that travelers receive timely travel updates and manage their reservations without disruptions or errors.

## Implicit Characters
### Feasibility (Cost/Time)
Achieving rapid time-to-market while managing development costs is a feasible goal with the selected "mini-services" architecture.

### Security
Implementing strong authentication and authorization mechanisms is vital to safeguard traveler information and data integrity.

### Maintainability

Ensuring clean code, documentation, and knowledge sharing within the development team are essential for long-term system maintainability.

### Observability

Implementing comprehensive monitoring and observability solutions enables efficient tracking of system performance and early issue detection for proactive problem-solving.
