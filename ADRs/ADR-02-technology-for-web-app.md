## ADR 006: Adoption of React.js for Rich User Interface


### Status: Proposed

## Context
We are designing the architecture for Road Warrior Application, and one of the key considerations is choosing the technology for building the user interface. The user interface plays a critical role in our application, and we need to select a framework or library that can provide a modern, efficient, Reusabel and maintainable UI solution.

Reusing React code in a React Native application is possible and can save you development time and effort, especially when you have shared logic or components between your web and mobile apps. React Native uses a similar component-based architecture to React for building user interfaces, which makes code reuse feasible. 

## Decision
We have decided to adopt React.js as our primary framework for building the user interface for the following reasons:

**Component-Based Architecture**: React.js offers a component-based architecture that promotes reusability, maintainability, and modular development, which aligns well with our project's requirements.

**Virtual DOM**: React's Virtual DOM minimizes DOM manipulation, improving performance and providing a smoother user experience.

**Ecosystem**: React has a rich ecosystem, including libraries (e.g., Redux for state management), tools (e.g., Create React App for project setup), and a strong community, which will help accelerate development and problem-solving.

**Declarative Syntax**: React's declarative syntax makes it easier to understand and reason about the UI components and their behavior.

**Large Adoption**: React is widely adopted in the industry, making it easier to find developers with React expertise and resources for training and documentation.

## Consequences
By choosing React.js as our UI framework, we accept the following consequences:

Team members will need to learn React and its associated ecosystem if they are not already familiar with it.
We may need to integrate React with other technologies and libraries as the project evolves.

## Alternatives
### Alternative 1: Angular
**Pros**: A complete framework with built-in features, strong TypeScript support.  
**Cons**: Steeper learning curve, potentially heavier and more opinionated than React.


### Alternative 2: Vue.js
**Pros**: Easy learning curve, flexible and approachable for small to medium-sized projects.  
**Cons**: Smaller community and ecosystem compared to React.

## Decision Rationale
React.js was chosen because of its strong component-based architecture, performance optimizations through the Virtual DOM, and extensive ecosystem. It aligns with our goal of building a modern, efficient, and maintainable user interface for our application. While alternatives were considered, React's widespread adoption and support make it a strong choice for the long-term success of our project.
