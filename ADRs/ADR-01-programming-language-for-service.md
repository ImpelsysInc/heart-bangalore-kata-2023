## Programming Language for Microservices
## Status: Proposed

## Context
We are starting a Road Warriors Application and need to choose a programming language for our MIcroservices services. Our requirements include high performance, scalability, maintainability, and efficient resource utilization.

## Decision
We have decided to adopt the Go programming language (Golang) as our primary language for Road Warriors Application for the following reasons:

**Microservice Support** : Using Go with the Gin web framework is a popular choice for building microservices due to the efficiency and performance of Go and the rapid development capabilities provided by Gin.

**Simple and Readable Syntax**: Go has a simple and clean syntax that is easy to read and maintain. This will enhance the maintainability of our codebase.

**High Performance**: Go is known for its high performance, making it suitable for building backend services that require low-latency and efficient resource utilization.

**Concurrency Support**: Go has built-in support for concurrency through goroutines and channels, making it well-suited for developing highly concurrent and scalable applications.

**Standard Library**: Go's standard library includes a wide range of packages for tasks like networking, encryption, and data serialization, reducing the need for third-party dependencies.

**Static Typing**: Go's static typing helps catch errors at compile-time, reducing the likelihood of runtime errors and improving code reliability.

**Strong Ecosystem**: Go has a strong and growing ecosystem of libraries, frameworks (e.g., Gin, Echo for web services), and tools (e.g., gofmt, go vet) that facilitate development and maintenance.

## Consequences
By adopting Go as our primary programming language, we accept the following consequences:

Team members who are not already familiar with Go can easily learn it since it is a simple language with fewer programming constructs.

## Alternatives
### Alternative 1: Node.js (JavaScript/TypeScript)
**Pros**: Familiarity for web developers, strong ecosystem, non-blocking I/O for high concurrency.  
**Cons**: Single-threaded, callback-based async programming can lead to complex code, not as efficient as Go for CPU-bound tasks.

### Alternative 2: Python
**Pros**: Known for simplicity and readability, extensive standard library, broad community support.  
**Cons**: Slower performance compared to Go, GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) limitations for concurrent execution.

### Alternative 3: Java
**Pros**: Rich Ecosystem,Strong Typing,Scalability, Developer Talent Pool etc.  
**Cons**: Development speed , Complexity , Resource Consumption, Cold Start Times and etc.


## Decision Rationale
Go was chosen because it aligns with our project requirements for Faster developemnt, minimal learning curve, high performance, scalability, and maintainability. Its built-in concurrency support, strong ecosystem, and static typing make it well-suited for building backend services efficiently. While other alternatives were considered, Go's combination of performance and simplicity makes it a strong choice for our software development project.
